# GenReqs

**GenReqs** is a Python tool that automatically detects the Python packages used in your project and generates a `requirements.txt` file. It also highlights packages installed in your virtual environment but not imported in your code, helping you keep your dependencies clean and manageable.

---

## Features

- Automatically scans Python files for imported packages.
- Cross-references imported packages with installed packages in your virtual environment.
- Generates a `requirements.txt` file with exact package versions.
- Identifies and lists packages installed but not used in your project.
- Supports specifying a custom virtual environment directory.

---

## Installation

### Using `pip`
First, make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. Then, install `genreqs` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install genreqs
```

Alternatively, clone the repository and install the package locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zelshahawy/genreqs.git
cd genreqs
python -m build
pip install dist/genreqs-*.whl
```

---

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run `genreqs` to scan all `.py` files in the current directory and subdirectories (up to a depth of 4) and generate a `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
genreqs
```

### Analyze Specific Files

You can analyze specific Python files by passing them as arguments:

```bash
genreqs file1.py file2.py
```

### Specify a Custom Virtual Environment

If your virtual environment is not named `venv` or `.venv`, you can specify its name using the `--add-venv-name` option:

```bash
genreqs --add-venv-name myenv
```

### Output Example

After running the tool, youâ€™ll get:
1. A `requirements.txt` file containing:
   ```
   pandas==1.5.2
   requests==2.28.1
   ```
2. A console output listing unused installed packages:
   ```
   The following packages are installed but not imported:
   flask
   numpy
   ```
